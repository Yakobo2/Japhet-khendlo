								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Japhet Khendlo is a seasoned academic, geospatial expert, and researcher whose work lies at the intersection of geospatial technologies, climate change resilience, sustainable development, and disaster management. His extensive experience covers various dimensions of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and environmental management. His diverse portfolio of work demonstrates his dedication to solving pressing global and local challenges through geospatial science, research, and education.

									<p>Climate Change and Environmental Modeling</p>
									Japhet’s PhD research focuses on the application of geospatial analysis for climate change and environmental modeling. He is exploring the integration of remote sensing, GIS, and machine learning to model environmental changes, predict climate impacts, and provide actionable insights for environmental sustainability. His work emphasizes how geospatial technologies can be used to track climate variables, assess vulnerabilities, and enhance resilience to climate-induced risks. He is conducting detailed studies on flood risks, water resource management, and ecosystem health in regions like Chikwawa District in Malawi and Siavonga in Zambia, investigating the socio-economic disparities in climate change exposure.
									
									<p>Geospatial Data Collection and Analysis.</p> 
									Japhet is highly skilled in geospatial data collection and analysis, utilizing remote sensing, GPS, and advanced data analytics to create accurate and actionable maps and models. His expertise includes the integration of big data analytics, Geo-AI, and multi-criteria decision analysis for optimizing infrastructure planning and disaster preparedness. He specializes in creating geospatial databases and processing spatial data to produce both static and dynamic models for real-time applications, such as monitoring environmental changes and assessing the impact of human activities on land use.
									
									<p>Geo-AI and Smart Infrastructure Development.</p>
									One of Japhet’s key areas of focus is the role of Geo-AI and big data analytics in smart and resilient infrastructure development. He is involved in a project titled "Geo-AI and Big Data Analytics in Infrastructure Development: Paving the Way for Smart, Resilient, and Sustainable Communities," where he demonstrates how geospatial technologies can optimize urban planning and enhance infrastructure resilience. His work addresses the integration of smart technologies in the built environment, with an emphasis on sustainable urban development in African cities like Lilongwe and Blantyre.
									
									<p>Disaster Management and Risk Mitigation.</p> 
									Japhet’s work in disaster management is centered around flood risk analysis and spatial variability assessment in vulnerable regions. In Chikwawa District, Malawi, he is using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to analyze flood risk exposure, accounting for spatial and socioeconomic disparities. His research also includes modeling surface runoff using the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS-CN) method to better predict areas at risk for flooding, which assists in disaster mitigation strategies and urban resilience planning.
									
									<p>Air Quality Monitoring and Pollution Analysis.</p> 
									Japhet has expanded his research into air quality monitoring, using Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data to analyze concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) and other pollutant gases. His work spans over several years, and he aims to apply machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived air quality data. His research in this area provides crucial information to policy makers, helping to devise effective pollution control measures in Malawi and beyond.
									
									<p>Sustainable Water Resource Management.</p>
									Water scarcity is another area where Japhet has concentrated his efforts. He is currently working on a project under the theme "EO for Managing Water Scarcity and Safeguarding Food Security in Africa," which responds to a call for African-led solutions. His research investigates how Earth Observation (EO) data and geospatial techniques can be used to manage water resources in drought-prone areas, promoting sustainable agricultural practices and food security.
									
									
									<p>Urban Planning and Infrastructure Development
										Japhet is an advocate for smart urban planning, particularly in fast-growing cities and towns across Africa. He integrates GIS and big data to assess the suitability of land for various types of infrastructure development, such as sewage treatment plants, schools, and other public facilities. His contributions in urban planning ensure that new developments are sustainable, resilient to climate change, and inclusive of socio-economic and environmental considerations..</p>
									
									<p>Community Engagement and Humanitarian Mapping
										Beyond his academic and research pursuits, Japhet has a strong commitment to community service. He has been involved in projects that engage local communities in climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction. Notably, Japhet launched a student-led Youth Mappers organization at Mzuzu University, empowering students to participate in open street mapping and humanitarian projects. These efforts contribute to global initiatives that ensure vulnerable communities are better prepared for natural disasters such as floods and cyclones..</p> 
									
									
									<p>Education and Capacity Building.<p>
										As a lecturer at Mzuzu University, Japhet is dedicated to advancing the knowledge of future generations of geospatial professionals. He has implemented innovative teaching methodologies, such as the 'research cluster' approach, which encourages students to work collaboratively on different study sites under a unified research theme. His teaching covers a wide range of topics, including remote sensing, geospatial data analysis, and disaster risk management, preparing students for the challenges of tomorrow
										Japhet also contributes to the professional development of surveyors and geospatial experts through workshops and conferences, such as his involvement with the Surveyors Institute of Malawi (SIM). His focus on integrating Geo-AI into the profession highlights his leadership in promoting cutting-edge technologies to enhance the capabilities of geospatial professionals..</p> 

									<p>Research and Publications.<p>
										Japhet has authored several research papers, technical reports, and contributed to handbooks focusing on climate change, water, and sanitation in small towns, particularly in Africa. His research output is both practical and scholarly, addressing real-world challenges while advancing academic knowledge in geospatial science, environmental management, and disaster resilience.</p>
